Good Evening _ County!
This is your radio host Rocking Rudy!
We'll get back to the jams in just a moment, but first it is time for the news.
Take it away, Ben!

Thank you, Rudy.
Our top story tonight concerns a rather shocking turn of events at our very own _ Park.
Authorities say some have spotted a strange figure lurking in the more secluded parts of the park.
Some claim this figure is tall and skinny with pale white skin.
Others claim it walks around on all fours and has all black fur.
Claims like these have gone on for weeks, but authorities claim they have spotted nothing in their searches.
They say these claims are a hoax, but still advise park goers to be on the lookout for anything that matches this description.
That is all for now. Stay tuned for more news.

Man. These prank calls to our local police are getting worse.
Pretty soon no ones gonna come to the park.
It's already tough enough for people to go outside without giving them a reason not to.
